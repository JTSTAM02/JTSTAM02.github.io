Was your first week what you expected? Why? Why not?

The first week of this bootcamp was full of ups and downs. I literally jumped for joy when I finally got my SSH key to work. I also fell to the depths of despair when I began analyzing the example blog and was blown away by the massive amount of code I saw. It's hard to believe I could ever become proficient enough in web development to be able to read, understand, and even create code like that. However, I know this is just the beginning of the jounrey. All I need to do is continue to step forward. I expected my week to be busy, but I had no clue how busy it would be. Between dangling work responsibilies and starting this intensive bootcamp, i felt tired and overwhelmed much of the week. 
What are you excited or eager to learn more about?

I am eager to learn more coding, particularly CSS and JavaScript. I feel that I have so much to learn and want to continue diving deeper into these topics. I also want to work on developing projects, so I can really apply what I am reading about and really harness the craft. Reading and taking notes is one thing; it takes true knowledge of a topic to be able to take those reading and create something with it.

What is something about you that can only be learned by reading this blog?
In this blog, you will see me open up more than I am custom to. I don't often feel I have alot to say to people, especially in terms of web development and coding skills. Lets work to change that!

  <h1>Welcome to Bootcamp!</h1>
  <img src="img/SadCoder.jpeg" alt="Stressed Programmer">
  <p>The first week of this bootcamp was full of ups and downs. Trying to finish one career and start the journey to another in the same week is mentally and physically exhausting. I definitely slept soundly every night. I had some great moments of success this week. I was stuck on some git commands for a long time, trying to authorize my account for hours. Running through tutorial after tutorial trying to find my error, or what I had to do to sync up my local repository and Github's. You can only press this Git commands for so long! Here's a few I've learned this week:
    ```
    git status 
    git clone
    git add
    git commit -m "Message"
    ```
    __And More!__
    
    I literally jumped for joy when I finally got my SSH key to work. I also fell to the depths of despair when I began analyzing the example blog and was blown away by the massive amount of code I saw. It’s hard to believe I could ever become proficient enough in web development to be able to read, understand, and even create code like that. It also blows my mind that people can create beautiful projects like the many examples I've seen this week through the Bootcamp. Programming is more than code; it is artistry. Artistry in a new tech driven world. It's easy to doubt yourself in a position like mine. Switching from teaching middle schoolers World History to learning high level programming languages is quite the change. However, I know this is just the beginning of the journey. All I need to do is continue to step forward. I expected my week to be busy, but I had no clue how busy it would be. Between dangling work responsibilities and starting this intensive bootcamp, I felt tired and overwhelmed much of the week. My focus was on perseverance. Persevere through the work day, and persevere through the bootcamp at night. Working hard for myself, for my wife, and for the family and life we hope to have one day. In order to be great at anything in this life, it takes grit and the determination to not give up. Lets hope I can keep that mindset throughout this adventure!

  <h3>Learning the Ways of the Git</h3>
  <p>  I am eager to learn more coding, particularly CSS and JavaScript. I feel that I have so much to learn and want to continue diving deeper into these topics. I also want to work on developing projects, so I can really apply what I am reading about and really harness the craft. Reading and taking notes is one thing; it takes true knowledge of a topic to be able to take those readings and *_create_* something with it. Before the bootcamp, I studied a few coding basics on my own. Basic HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript and Python via VS Code. But this week has opened my eyes to a new world: GitHub. Using git commands and the CLI to commit files to Github, utilizing GitPod within the site, and even creating forks and clones has shown me how much I have to learn about this world. It’s not all about knowing the code. It’s also collaboration, connection with others, and utilizing all the various tools and resources that are out there.
